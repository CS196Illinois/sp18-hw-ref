def factorial(the_num):
    """
    Returns the factorial of a number. This is the product of all integers between 1 and the number, inclusive.
    
    Examples:
        Input:
            the_num = 5
        Output:
            120
            5 factorial (5!) = 5*4*3*2*1

    Args:
        (int) the_num: input number

    Returns:
        (int) the factorial of the_num

def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Returns the nth fibonacci number.
    
    The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively. The 0th and 1st Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1,
    and the nth Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.
    
    Args:
        (int) n: Which fibonacci number to find

    Returns:
        (int) the nth Fibonacci number

def longest_increasing_subsequence(arr):
    """
    Given a list of numbers, returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    
    A subsequence is an ordered but not necessarily contiguous part of an array.
    
    Examples:
        Input:
            [1,5,2,3]
        Output:
            3
            The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3].
            For this array:
            [1,5] is also an increasing subsequence.
            [1,2,3,5] is increasing, but not a subsequence.
            [5,3] is a subsequence, but not increasing.
            [3,2] is neither increasing nor a subsequence.
    
    Args:
        ([int]) arr: The input list

    Returns:
        (int) the length of the longest increasing subsequence
